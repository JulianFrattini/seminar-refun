**Requirements Engineering: a brief introduction** is a very concise summary of the most important concepts of requirements engineering (RE) and their application. 
It was originally developed as a guest lecture for a software engineering (SE) course to provide Bachelor level students with a general overview of (RE) theory[^1] and techniques.[^2]
The material does not require any prior knowledge about RE, but assumes a basic understanding of SE process models.
